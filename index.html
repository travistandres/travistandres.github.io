    <h1>Finding Beauty in the Mundane</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by the little things in life, the theme revolves around the subtle things that we often take for granted. Anywhere you look can be turned into a work of art. Whether it be a shoe, or a tree. I think this is where an artist can show his talent and style, turning something so boring to a masterpiece with emotional poignancy. We will be looking at 3 artists and each of their own work. This includes Edward Hopper, Vincent van Gogh, and Gim Hongdo.   </h3>

      <h2>Edward Hopper</h2>
    <img src="hopper.jpg" style="width: 30%;" alt="">
    <h3>Edward Hopper was an American photorealistic painter and printmaker. He is well known for his oil paintings, but he was equally familiar with etching as a watercolor painter and printer. His career has greatly benefited  from his marriage to  Josephine Nivison, an artist who has made significant contributions to his work, both as a life model and as a creative partner. Hopper was a minor key artist, creating calm dramas from everyday themes, often with  poetic meanings that led to unintentional narrative interpretations. He has been praised for 'complete verity' in the America he portrayed.

    <br> <br> Oil on Canvas</p>
    
    </div>
      <h2>
        Early Sunday Morning is certainly considered one among Edward Hopper`s most iconic paintings. He painted a street in New York to it's barebones look, the human presence is gone and the words on the window is illegible. This painting has this sense of isolation because of the absence of people. The early sun shines through the painting, creating long shadows from the pole and fire hydrant. The vertical lines created by the windows contrasts the horizontal lines of the curb and the shadows. This work shows his emphasis on simple objects and composition.

    <h3 id="align">Vincent van Gogh, his full name Vincent Willem van Gogh, is a widely recognized Dutch painter and one of the greatest Post-Impressionists. The unique colors, emphasized brushstrokes and contoured shapes of his work strongly influenced the movement of expressionism in contemporary art. Van Gogh's art was surprisingly popular after his death, especially in the late 20th century.

      <h2>
          A still life painting by Van gogh during his trip to Paris. A pair of shoes sitting in a textured floor. The sun hitting the shoe at an angle, which creates a shadow. The way Van gogh creates this shadow is somewhat interesting. Little strokes of brushes instead of blacking it out. It is truly amazing how Van gogh can make something so ordinary like a pair of shoes and make it exciting and more pleasing to look at.

He was collectively the pillar of the founding and a key figure in the new trend of his time, "True View Painting". Gim Hongdo was an outstanding artist in all areas of traditional painting today, even if it is memorable for portraying the everyday life of the general public.

      <h2>
         A piece from Hongdo. It's just a plum tree, simple as that, but when you look deeper it can also mean other things like calmness, tranquility. It can also be interpreted as a rebirth as the flowers start to bloom, or death, time running out, when the flowers start to wither away. The way it is isolated and there are no distractions in the background, Hongdo really wanted to emphasize the Plum tree. And you can also feel the loneliness of the piece. Like when you're old and alone and just waiting to die from old age.

      <h3>
        The Kansong Art Museum was established in 1938 and located at Seoul Seongbuk-gu, it was established to collect, preserve, research, and showcase antique Korean Art. This museum was Korea's first independent museum. <br><br>

        During the harsh years of Japanese colonial rule, colonial forces destroyed or exported vast amounts of Korean cultural heritage in the form of paintings, books, ceramics, calligraphy, towers and stupas. This removal of art history was one of many attempts by the Japanese colonial government to distort history and destroy traditional Korean culture  in order to perpetuate Japan's colonization of Korea. The Kansong Art Museum sincerely believed that the liberation of South Korea would come someday, and acted  to prepare for the future of the liberated South Korea.
