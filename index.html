        Mount Asgard is a mountain in Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. The mountain has two mountain peaks. The mountain peaks are flat at the top, in a circular shape. The peaks are connected by a large piece of rock. THe mountain is on the Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island and it is part of the Baffin Mountains mountain range. THe mountain is made up of Granite. THe mountain is named after Asgard. Asgard is the home of the gods in Norse mythology. This mountain is famous for climbers. It was climbed for the first time in 1953 by J. Weber, J. Marmet, and H. Rothlisberger. They were Swiss scientists that were part of the Arctic Institute Baggin Island Expedition.
        <br><br>
        The Baffin Island forms the edge of the Precambrian Shield which is comprised of the oldest rocks on Earth. Its unique landscape was created mainly under the influence of glaciers. So Mount Asgard was formed by Glaciers. Only Glaciers could form these types of mountains which are called "Horns"

        Crowley Lake is 15 miles from Mammoth Lakes and is actually a reservoir that was created in 1941 by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power when they built the Long Valley Dam. The lake is extremely popular for trout fishing and thereâ€™s a marina on the south end.
        <br><br>
        These helical columns were formed after a volcanic eruption that occurred over 760,000 years ago. Snowmelt seeped into the still hot tuff, causing the water to boil and create even spaces between the columns. But they remained buried until the reservoir was built. It was the constant pounding of waves that slowly carved out the softer material at the base of the cliffs, which are made up of pumice. Since its discovery, scientists have counted over 5,000 columns covering over a mile of shoreline on the east side of the lake, varying in color, height, and shape.

       These sailing stones are somewhat an unusual phenomenon, how could these rocks move by themselves in a dessert? Like some ghost pushed it every now and then. These Sailing Stones can be seen at Racetrack Playa, a dry lake bed in Death Valley National Park at California.
       <br><br>
       It was an unsolved mystery until 2014 when two cousins found evidence of what pushes these rocks to move. They discovered that due to panels of thin floating ice that are driven by light winds in winter, the friction lessens allowing the rock to glide through the dessert landscape. This means that there should be a shallow body of water nearby for these ice panels to form.
      <br><br>
      The rocks itself are rocks that contain Dolomite and Syenite.

      Iceland, very beautiful country to go. Iceland is the 2nd largest Island in Europe and the 18th largest island in the world. Iceland lies at the point where the arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Oceans meet. Always wondered why it's called Iceland since it's mainly green, while Greenland is covered in Ice. Still is a mystery to me. 
      <br><br>
      That said, it's because Iceland is a product of a diverging plate boundary causing lava to reach the surface and cools down to create land. Iceland also has a hotpot, like hawaii. all this means that Iceland is rich in geothermal energy and because of the geothermal heat around the volcanic activity which Iceland has. This is their main source of their energy.
