    <h3>Inspired by the little things in life, the theme revolves around the subtle things that we often take for granted. Anywhere you look can be turned into a work of art. Whether it be a shoe, or a tree. I think this is where an artist can show his talent and style, turning something so boring to a masterpiece with emotional poignancy.   </h3>

    <h3>Edward Hopper was an American realist painter and printmaker. While he is widely known for his oil paintings, he was equally proficient as a watercolorist and printmaker in etching. His career benefited decisively from his marriage to fellow-artist Josephine Nivison, who contributed much to his work, both as a life-model and as a creative partner. Hopper was a minor-key artist, creating subdued drama out of commonplace subjects 'layered with a poetic meaning', inviting narrative interpretations, often unintended. He was praised for 'complete verity' in the America he portrayed. <i style="color: gray;">(Wikipedia)</i>

      <h2>
        Early Sunday Morning is certainly considered one among Edward Hopper`s most iconic paintings. He painted a street in New York to it's barebones look, the human presence is gone and the words on the window is illegible. This painting has this sense of isolation because of the absence of people. The early sun shines through the painting, creating long shadows from the pole and fire hydrant. The vertical lines created by the windows contrasts the horizontal lines of the curb and the shadows. This work shows his emphasis on simple objects and composition.
